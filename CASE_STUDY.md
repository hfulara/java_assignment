# Case Study Scenarios to discuss

## Scenario 1: Cost Allocation and Tracking
**Situation**: The company needs to track and allocate costs accurately across different Warehouses and Stores. The costs include labor, inventory, transportation, and overhead expenses.

**Task**: Discuss the challenges in accurately tracking and allocating costs in a fulfillment environment. Think about what are important considerations for this, what are previous experiences that you have you could related to this problem and elaborate some questions and considerations

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Tracking costs in a fulfillment environment is challenging because many costs are shared across Warehouses and Stores and vary with volume and operational changes. Key considerations include defining clear cost drivers, ensuring consistent data collection, and correctly allocating indirect costs such as overhead and transportation. From experience, misalignment between operational data and financial systems is a common issue, so it’s important to clarify the required level of granularity and how frequently costs should be recalculated ]

## Scenario 2: Cost Optimization Strategies
**Situation**: The company wants to identify and implement cost optimization strategies for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to reduce overall costs without compromising service quality.

**Task**: Discuss potential cost optimization strategies for fulfillment operations and expected outcomes from that. How would you identify, prioritize and implement these strategies?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Effective cost optimization starts with visibility into where costs are generated. Strategies may include improving warehouse utilization, optimizing inventory placement, reducing transportation inefficiencies, and increasing automation. I would prioritize initiatives based on cost impact and feasibility, validate them through small pilots, and then scale successful changes. The expected outcome is lower fulfillment costs without negatively impacting service quality. ]

## Scenario 3: Integration with Financial Systems
**Situation**: The Cost Control Tool needs to integrate with existing financial systems to ensure accurate and timely cost data. The integration should support real-time data synchronization and reporting.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of integrating the Cost Control Tool with financial systems. What benefits the company would have from that and how would you ensure seamless integration and data synchronization?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Integration with financial systems ensures accurate, consistent, and timely cost data across the organization. The main benefits are reduced manual reconciliation, faster reporting, and better decision-making. To ensure smooth integration, I would focus on clear data contracts, API or event-based synchronization, and strong validation and monitoring to detect inconsistencies early. ]

## Scenario 4: Budgeting and Forecasting
**Situation**: The company needs to develop budgeting and forecasting capabilities for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to predict future costs and allocate resources effectively.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of budgeting and forecasting in fulfillment operations and what would you take into account designing a system to support accurate budgeting and forecasting?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Budgeting and forecasting are critical for anticipating future costs and allocating resources effectively. A reliable forecasting approach should consider demand trends, seasonality, and historical cost patterns. When designing such a system, I would ensure it supports scenario planning and allows forecasts to be updated as new data becomes available, helping teams identify potential budget risks early. ]

## Scenario 5: Cost Control in Warehouse Replacement
**Situation**: The company is planning to replace an existing Warehouse with a new one. The new Warehouse will reuse the Business Unit Code of the old Warehouse. The old Warehouse will be archived, but its cost history must be preserved.

**Task**: Discuss the cost control aspects of replacing a Warehouse. Why is it important to preserve cost history and how this relates to keeping the new Warehouse operation within budget?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Preserving cost history during a Warehouse replacement is important for continuity and performance comparison. Historical data helps set realistic budgets and evaluate whether the new Warehouse is operating more efficiently. Keeping past and current costs linked but clearly separated enables better cost control and quicker identification of deviations from budget. ]

## Instructions for Candidates
Before starting the case study, read the [BRIEFING.md](BRIEFING.md) to quickly understand the domain, entities, business rules, and other relevant details.

**Analyze the Scenarios**: Carefully analyze each scenario and consider the tasks provided. To make informed decisions about the project's scope and ensure valuable outcomes, what key information would you seek to gather before defining the boundaries of the work? Your goal is to bridge technical aspects with business value, bringing a high level discussion; no need to deep dive.
